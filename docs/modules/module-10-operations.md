# Module 10: Operations Management

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"
    By the end of this module, you will be able to:
    
    1.  Design standard operating procedures (SOPs) for a control room.
    2.  Manage resources, incidents, and system maintenance effectively.
    3.  Implement configuration management and change control processes.

## 1. Control Room Procedures (SOPs)

A TMC is a high-pressure environment. Operators shouldn't have to "guess" what to do during a major crash. They follow **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**.

### Example SOP: Stall on a Bridge
1.  **Detect:** Operator sees a vehicle stopped on camera.
2.  **Dispatch:** Notify the "Highway Patrol" or Tow Truck.
3.  **Inform:** Update the Dynamic Message Signs (DMS) to "STALLED VEHICLE AHEAD."
4.  **Log:** Record the event in the management system.

## 2. Resource Allocation

Managing "Resources" means balancing:
*   **Personnel:** Having enough operators during rush hour.
*   **Budget:** Deciding whether to fix a broken camera or paint road lines.
*   **Equipment:** Keeping spare signal controllers in the warehouse.

## 3. System Maintenance

ITS equipment lives in harsh environments (rain, sun, dust).

| Maintenance Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Preventative** | Cleaning camera lenses every 6 months to prevent blurry images. |
| **Corrective** | Fixing a signal after it gets hit by a car (Reactive). |
| **Predictive** | Using data to predict when a lightbulb will fail *before* it does. |

## 4. Configuration Management & Change Control

### Configuration Management
Keeping an accurate inventory of every device:
*   Model Number
*   IP Address
*   Software Version (Firmware)
*   Location

### Change Control
Never change a setting on a Friday afternoon! 
**Change Control** is a formal process where any change to the system must be:
1.  Requested
2.  Reviewed (Will this crash the network?)
3.  Approved
4.  **Tested** (In a lab first)
5.  Deployed

## 5. Emergency Procedures (COOP)

What if the TMC itself is destroyed (e.g., fire or flood)?
Every city needs a **Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)**.
*   **Backup TMC:** A small office in another part of the city that can take control.
*   **Cloud-based Control:** Allowing operators to manage signals from home via a secure laptop.

## ✅ Module 10 Checkpoint

??? check "Test your knowledge"
    **Q1: What is the primary purpose of a "Change Control" process?**
    
    - [ ] To prevent people from making any changes.
    - [x] To ensure that changes are tested and approved so they don't cause system failures.
    - [ ] To document the cost of new equipment.
    
    **Q2: Which type of maintenance involves cleaning a camera lens regularly?**
    
    - [ ] Corrective
    - [x] Preventative
